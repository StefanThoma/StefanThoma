## Hi there, I'm Stefan!

Welcome to my Github page. I'm a data scientist with a passion for open science and woodworking. 
Here you'll find a selection of projects I've worked on, ranging from my  [masters thesis](https://github.com/StefanThoma/ReplicationRelevance) and [research projects](https://github.com/StefanThoma/VR_Environmental_Awareness) to toy data analysis problems from [application procedures](https://github.com/StefanThoma/Technical-Task-2022)

## Current work & interests
- Data Scientist at Roche, where I'm working on the open source tools admiral and teal for clinical trial analyses.   
- Woodworking & Coffee, my hobbies outside of work that keep me grounded and creative.

## Research

- Impact of VR on environmental attitudes, investigating how immersive experiences can promote pro-environmental behaviors and attitudes.
- Measure of relevance in many-lab studies, developing a novel statistical approach to quantify the impact of studies conducted across multiple labs.

##Education
- MSc in Statistics, where I learned advanced statistical methods and how to apply them to real-world problems.
- MSc in Psychology, where I explored the fascinating world of human behavior and cognition.
